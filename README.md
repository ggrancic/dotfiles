# Gian's Dotfiles

This are my configuration files of some programs I use. To "deploy" them, you need stow installed on your system. Once you have stow installed, simply run

```
stow nameofthefolder
```

The programs are:

- i3
- i3status
- Tmux
- alacritty
- picom
- rofi
- Theme and icons for gtk apps
- wallpapers

- Fonts used are: Ubuntu Regular (GUI), mononoki (terminal)
