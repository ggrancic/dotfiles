This are my configuration files of some programs I use. To "deploy" them, you need stow installed on your system. Once you have stow installed, simply run stow <name of the folder>.

The programs are:

- i3
- i3status
- ranger
- Neovim (latest version)
- Tmux
- urxvt

You also need fonts-font-awesome installed to render the glyphs in i3status workspace indicators.
